Weakest-meseems-\\nOur battle shows where Bhishma holds command,\\nAnd Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!\\nHave care our captains nigh to Bhishma\\'s ranks\\nPrepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!\"\\n\\nThen, at the signal of the aged king,\\nWith blare to wake the blood, rolling around\\nLike to a lion\\'s roar, the trumpeter\\nBlew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it,\\nTrumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns\\nBurst into sudden clamour; as the blasts\\nOf loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed!\\nThen might be seen, upon their car of gold\\nYoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,\\nKrishna the God, Arjuna at his side:\\nKrishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch\\nCarved of the \"Giant\\'s bone;\" Arjuna blew\\nIndra\\'s loud gift; Bhima the terrible--\\nWolf-bellied Bhima-blew a long reed-conch;\\nAnd Yudhisthira, Kunti\\'s blameless son,\\nWinded a mighty shell, \"Victory\\'s Voice;\"\\nAnd Nakula blew shrill upon his conch\\nNamed the \"Sweet-sounding,\" Sahadev on his\\nCalled\"Gem-bedecked,\" and Kasi\\'s Prince on his.\\nSikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn,\\nVirata, Satyaki the Unsubdued,\\nDrupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!)\\nLong-armed Subhadra\\'s children, all blew loud,\\nSo that the clangour shook their foemen\\'s hearts,\\nWith quaking earth and thundering heav\\'n.\\n\\nThen \\'twas-\\nBeholding Dhritirashtra\\'s battle set,\\nWeapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war\\nInstant to break-Arjun, whose ensign-badge\\nWas Hanuman the monkey, spake this thing\\nTo Krishna the Divine, his charioteer:\\n\"Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground\\nBetwixt the armies; I would see more nigh\\nThese who will fight with us, those we must slay\\nTo-day, in war\\'s arbitrament; for, sure,\\nOn bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain,\\nObeying Dhritirashtra\\'s sinful son.\"\\n\\nThus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!)\\nBetween the hosts that heavenly Charioteer\\nDrove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds\\nWhere Bhishma led,and Drona,and their Lords.\\n\"See!\" spake he to Arjuna, \"where they stand,\\nThy kindred of the Kurus:\" and the Prince\\nMarked on each hand the kinsmen of his house,\\nGrandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons,\\nCousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed\\nWith friends and honoured elders; some this side,\\nSome that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed,\\nSuch kith grown enemies-Arjuna\\'s heart\\nMelted with pity, while he uttered this:\\n\\nArjuna.\\nKrishna! as I behold, come here to shed\\nTheir common blood, yon concourse of our kin,\\nMy members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth,\\nA shudder thrills my body, and my hair\\nBristles with horror; from my weak hand slips\\nGandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns\\nMy skin to parching; hardly may I stand;\\nThe life within me seems to swim and faint;\\nNothing do I foresee save woe and wail!\\nIt is not good, O Keshav! nought of good\\nCan spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate\\nTriumph and domination, wealth and ease,\\nThus sadly won! Aho! what victory\\nCan bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils\\nCould profit; what rule recompense; what span\\nOf life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood?\\nSeeing that these stand here, ready to die,\\nFor whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased,\\nAnd power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons,\\nBrothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law,\\nElders and friends! Shall I deal death on these\\nEven though they seek to slay us? Not one blow,\\nO Madhusudan! will I strike to gain\\n\\nThe rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less\\nTo seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these\\nMust breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be\\nGuilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths;\\nTheir sins will light on us, if we shall slay\\nThose sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;\\nWhat peace could come of that, O Madhava?\\nFor if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,\\nThese cannot see, or will not see, the sin\\nOf kingly lines o\\'erthrown and kinsmen slain,\\nHow should not we, who see, shun such a crime--\\nWe who perceive the guilt and feel the shame--\\nO thou Delight of Men, Janardana?\\nBy overthrow of houses perisheth\\nTheir sweet continuous household piety,\\nAnd-rites neglected, piety extinct--\\nEnters impiety upon that home;\\nIts women grow unwomaned, whence there spring\\nMad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,\\nSending a Hell-ward road that family,\\nAnd whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.\\nNay, and the souls of honoured ancestors\\nFall from their place of peace, being bereft\\nOf funeral-cakes and the wan death-water.[FN#1]\\nSo teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay\\nKinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,\\nAhovat! what an evil fault it were!\\nBetter I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,\\nTo face them weaponless, and bare my breast\\nTo shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.\\n\\nSo speaking, in the face of those two hosts,\\nArjuna sank upon his chariot-seat,\\nAnd let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.\\n\\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER I. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,\\nEntitled \"Arjun-Vishad,\"\\nOr \"The Book of the Distress of Arjuna.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nSanjaya.\\nHim, filled with such compassion and such grief,\\nWith eyes tear-dimmed, despondent, in stern words\\nThe Driver, Madhusudan, thus addressed:\\n\\nKrishna.\\nHow hath this weakness taken thee? Whence springs\\nThe inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave,\\nBarring the path of virtue? Nay, Arjun!\\nForbid thyself to feebleness! it mars\\nThy warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit!\\nWake! Be thyself! Arise, Scourge of thy Foes!\\n\\nArjuna.\\nHow can I, in the battle, shoot with shafts\\nOn Bhishma, or on Drona-O thou Chief!--\\nBoth worshipful, both honourable men?\\n\\nBetter to live on beggar\\'s bread\\nWith those we love alive,\\nThan taste their blood in rich feasts spread,\\nAnd guiltily survive!\\nAh! were it worse-who knows?--to be\\nVictor or vanquished here,\\nWhen those confront us angrily\\nWhose death leaves living drear?\\nIn pity lost, by doubtings tossed,\\nMy thoughts-distracted-turn\\nTo Thee, the Guide I reverence most,\\nThat I may counsel learn:\\nI know not what would heal the grief\\nBurned into soul and sense,\\nIf I were earth\\'s unchallenged chief--\\nA god--and these gone thence!\\n\\nSanjaya.\\nSo spake Arjuna to the Lord of Hearts,\\nAnd sighing,\"I will not fight!\" held silence then.\\nTo whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata! )\\nWhile the Prince wept despairing \\'twixt those hosts,\\nKrishna made answer in divinest verse:\\n\\nKrishna.\\nThou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak\\'st\\nWords lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart\\nMourn not for those that live, nor those that die.\\nNor I, nor thou, nor any one of these,\\nEver was not, nor ever will not be,\\nFor ever and for ever afterwards.\\nAll, that doth live, lives always! To man\\'s frame\\nAs there come infancy and youth and age,\\nSo come there raisings-up and layings-down\\nOf other and of other life-abodes,\\nWhich the wise know, and fear not. This that irks--\\nThy sense-life, thrilling to the elements--\\nBringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys,\\n\\'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince!\\nAs the wise bear. The soul which is not moved,\\nThe soul that with a strong and constant calm\\nTakes sorrow and takes joy indifferently,\\nLives in the life undying! That which is\\nCan never cease to be; that which is not\\nWill not exist. To see this truth of both\\nIs theirs who part essence from accident,\\nSubstance from shadow. Indestructible,\\nLearn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all;\\nIt cannot anywhere, by any means,\\nBe anywise diminished, stayed, or changed.\\nBut for these fleeting frames which it informs\\nWith spirit deathless, endless, infinite,\\nThey perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight!\\nHe who shall say, \"Lo! I have slain a man!\"\\nHe who shall think, \"Lo! I am slain!\" those both\\nKnow naught! Life cannot slay. Life is not slain!\\nNever the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never;\\nNever was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams!\\nBirthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever;\\nDeath hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it seems!\\n\\nWho knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained,\\nImmortal, indestructible,--shall such\\nSay, \"I have killed a man, or caused to kill?\"\\n\\nNay, but as when one layeth\\nHis worn-out robes away,\\nAnd taking new ones, sayeth,\\n\"These will I wear to-day!\"\\nSo putteth by the spirit\\nLightly its garb of flesh,\\nAnd passeth to inherit\\nA residence afresh.\\n\\nI say to thee weapons reach not the Life;\\nFlame burns it not, waters cannot o\\'erwhelm,\\nNor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable,\\nUnentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched,\\nImmortal, all-arriving, stable, sure,\\nInvisible, ineffable, by word\\nAnd thought uncompassed, ever all itself,\\nThus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,--\\nKnowing it so,--grieve when thou shouldst not grieve?\\nHow, if thou hearest that the man new-dead\\nIs, like the man new-born, still living man--\\nOne same, existent Spirit--wilt thou weep?\\nThe end of birth is death; the end of death\\nIs birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou,\\nChief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls\\nWhich could not otherwise befall? The birth\\nOf living things comes unperceived; the death\\nComes unperceived; between them, beings perceive:\\nWhat is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince?\\n\\nWonderful, wistful, to contemplate!\\nDifficult, doubtful, to speak upon!\\nStrange and great for tongue to relate,\\nMystical hearing for every one!\\nNor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is,\\nWhen seeing, and saying, and hearing are done!\\n\\nThis Life within all living things, my Prince!\\nHides beyond harm; scorn thou to suffer, then,\\nFor that which cannot suffer. Do thy part!\\nBe mindful of thy name, and tremble not!\\nNought better can betide a martial soul\\nThan lawful war; happy the warrior\\nTo whom comes joy of battle--comes, as now,\\nGlorious and fair, unsought; opening for him\\nA gateway unto Heav\\'n. But, if thou shunn\\'st\\nThis honourable field--a Kshattriya--\\nIf, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd\\'st\\nDuty and task go by--that shall be sin!\\nAnd those to come shall speak thee infamy\\nFrom age to age; but infamy is worse\\nFor men of noble blood to bear than death!\\nThe chiefs upon their battle-chariots\\nWill deem \\'twas fear that drove thee from the fray.\\nOf those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn\\nThou must abide, while all thine enemies\\nWill scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock\\nThe valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall\\nMore grievously than this? Either--being killed--\\nThou wilt win Swarga\\'s safety, or--alive\\nAnd victor--thou wilt reign an earthly king.\\nTherefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace\\nThine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet--\\nAs things alike to thee--pleasure or pain,\\nProfit or ruin, victory or defeat:\\nSo minded, gird thee to the fight, for so\\nThou shalt not sin!\\n\\nThus far I speak to thee\\nAs from the \"Sankhya\"--unspiritually--\\nHear now the deeper teaching of the Yog,\\nWhich holding, understanding, thou shalt burst\\nThy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds.\\nHere shall no end be hindered, no hope marred,\\nNo loss be feared: faith--yea, a little faith--\\nShall save thee from the anguish of thy dread.\\nHere, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule--\\nOne steadfast rule--while shifting souls have laws\\nMany and hard. Specious, but wrongful deem\\nThe speech of those ill-taught ones who extol\\nThe letter of their Vedas, saying, \"This\\nIs all we have, or need;\" being weak at heart\\nWith wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes--they say--\\nAs \"fruit of good deeds done;\" promising men\\nMuch profit in new births for works of faith;\\nIn various rites abounding; following whereon\\nLarge merit shall accrue towards wealth and power;\\nAlbeit, who wealth and power do most desire\\nLeast fixity of soul have such, least hold\\nOn heavenly meditation. Much these teach,\\nFrom Veds, concerning the \"three qualities;\"\\nBut thou, be free of the \"three qualities,\"\\nFree of the \"pairs of opposites,\"[FN#2] and free\\nFrom that sad righteousness which calculates;\\nSelf-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied![FN#3]\\nLook! like as when a tank pours water forth\\nTo suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw\\nText for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.\\nBut thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward\\nOf doing right in right! Let right deeds be\\nThy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.\\nAnd live in action! Labour! Make thine acts\\nThy piety, casting all self aside,\\nContemning gain and merit; equable\\nIn good or evil: equability\\nIs Yog, is piety!\\n\\nYet, the right act\\nIs less, far less, than the right-thinking mind.\\nSeek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven!\\nScorn them that follow virtue for her gifts!\\nThe mind of pure devotion--even here--\\nCasts equally aside good deeds and bad,\\nPassing above them. Unto pure devotion\\nDevote thyself: with perfect meditation\\nComes perfect act, and the right-hearted rise--\\nMore certainly because they seek no gain--\\nForth from the bands of body, step by step,\\nTo highest seats of bliss. When thy firm soul\\nHath shaken off those tangled oracles\\nWhich ignorantly guide, then shall it soar\\nTo high neglect of what\\'s denied or said,\\nThis way or that way, in doctrinal writ.\\nTroubled no longer by the priestly lore,\\nSafe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent\\nOn meditation. This is Yog--and Peace!\\n\\nArjuna.\\nWhat is his mark who hath that steadfast heart,\\nConfirmed in holy meditation? How\\nKnow we his speech, Kesava? Sits he, moves he\\nLike other men?\\n\\nKrishna.\\nWhen one, O Pritha\\'s Son!\\nAbandoning desires which shake the mind--\\nFinds in his soul full comfort for his soul,\\nHe hath attained the Yog--that man is such!\\nIn sorrows not dejected, and in joys\\nNot overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress\\nOf passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms\\nOf lofty contemplation;--such an one\\nIs Muni, is the Sage, the true Recluse!\\nHe who to none and nowhere overbound\\nBy ties of flesh, takes evil things and good\\nNeither desponding nor exulting, such\\nBears wisdom\\'s plainest mark! He who shall draw\\nAs the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe\\nUnder its shield, his five frail senses back\\nUnder the spirit\\'s buckler from the world\\nWhich else assails them, such an one, my Prince!\\nHath wisdom\\'s mark! Things that solicit sense\\nHold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes,\\nThe appetites of him who lives beyond\\nDepart,--aroused no more. Yet may it chance,\\nO Son of Kunti! that a governed mind\\nShall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest\\nStrong self-control by the roots. Let him regain\\nHis kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit\\nOn Me intent. That man alone is wise\\nWho keeps the mastery of himself! If one\\nPonders on objects of the sense, there springs\\nAttraction; from attraction grows desire,\\nDesire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds\\nRecklessness; then the memory--all betrayed--\\nLets noble purpose go, and saps the mind,\\nTill purpose, mind, and man are all undone.\\nBut, if one deals with objects of the sense\\nNot loving and not hating, making them\\nServe his free soul, which rests serenely lord,\\nLo! such a man comes to tranquillity;\\nAnd out of that tranquillity shall rise\\nThe end and healing of his earthly pains,\\nSince the will governed sets the soul at peace.\\nThe soul of the ungoverned is not his,\\nNor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked,\\nHow grows serenity? and, wanting that,\\nWhence shall he hope for happiness?\\n\\nThe mind\\nThat gives itself to follow shows of sense\\nSeeth its helm of wisdom rent away,\\nAnd, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives\\nTo wreck and death. Only with him, great Prince!\\nWhose senses are not swayed by things of sense--\\nOnly with him who holds his mastery,\\nShows wisdom perfect. What is midnight-gloom\\nTo unenlightened souls shines wakeful day\\nTo his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day\\nIs known for night, thick night of ignorance,\\nTo his true-seeing eyes. Such is the Saint!\\n\\nAnd like the ocean, day by day receiving\\nFloods from all lands, which never overflows\\nIts boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving,\\nFed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;--\\n\\nSo is the perfect one! to his soul\\'s ocean\\nThe world of sense pours streams of witchery;\\nThey leave him as they find, without commotion,\\nTaking their tribute, but remaining sea.\\n\\nYea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh\\nLives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free\\nFrom pride, from passion, from the sin of \"Self,\"\\nToucheth tranquillity! O Pritha\\'s Son!\\nThat is the state of Brahm! There rests no dread\\nWhen that last step is reached! Live where he will,\\nDie when he may, such passeth from all \\'plaining,\\nTo blest Nirvana, with the Gods, attaining.\\n\\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER II. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,\\nEntitled \"Sankhya-Yog,\"\\nOr \"The Book of Doctrines.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nArjuna.\\nThou whom all mortals praise, Janardana!\\nIf meditation be a nobler thing\\nThan action, wherefore, then, great Kesava!\\nDost thou impel me to this dreadful fight?\\nNow am I by thy doubtful speech disturbed!\\nTell me one thing, and tell me certainly;\\nBy what road shall I find the better end?\\n\\nKrishna.\\nI told thee, blameless Lord! there be two paths\\nShown to this world; two schools of wisdom.\\n\\nFirst\\nThe Sankhya\\'s, which doth save in way of works\\nPrescribed[FN#4] by reason; next, the Yog, which bids\\nAttain by meditation, spiritually:\\nYet these are one! No man shall \\'scape from act\\nBy shunning action; nay, and none shall come\\nBy mere renouncements unto perfectness.\\nNay, and no jot of time, at any time,\\nRests any actionless; his nature\\'s law\\nCompels him, even unwilling, into act;\\n[For thought is act in fancy]. He who sits\\nSuppressing all the instruments of flesh,\\nYet in his idle heart thinking on them,\\nPlays the inept and guilty hypocrite:\\nBut he who, with strong body serving mind,\\nGives up his mortal powers to worthy work,\\nNot seeking gain, Arjuna! such an one\\nIs honourable. Do thine allotted task!\\nWork is more excellent than idleness;\\nThe body\\'s life proceeds not, lacking work.\\nThere is a task of holiness to do,\\nUnlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not\\nThe faithful soul; such earthly duty do\\nFree from desire, and thou shalt well perform\\nThy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati--\\nIn the beginning, when all men were made,\\nAnd, with mankind, the sacrifice-- \"Do this!\\nWork! sacrifice! Increase and multiply\\nWith sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk,\\nYour \\'Cow of Plenty,\\' giving back her milk\\nOf all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;\\nThe gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye crave\\nThe gods will grant to Labour, when it pays\\nTithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats\\nFruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven\\nNo gift of toil, that thief steals from his world.\"\\n\\nWho eat of food after their sacrifice\\nAre quit of fault, but they that spread a feast\\nAll for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin.\\nBy food the living live; food comes of rain,\\nAnd rain comes by the pious sacrifice,\\nAnd sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil;\\nThus action is of Brahma, who is One,\\nThe Only, All-pervading; at all times\\nPresent in sacrifice. He that abstains\\nTo help the rolling wheels of this great world,\\nGlutting his idle sense, lives a lost life,\\nShameful and vain. Existing for himself,\\nSelf-concentrated, serving self alone,\\nNo part hath he in aught; nothing achieved,\\nNought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope\\nOf help for all the living things of earth\\nDepends from him.[FN#5] Therefore, thy task prescribed\\nWith spirit unattached gladly perform,\\nSince in performance of plain duty man\\nMounts to his highest bliss. By works alone\\nJanak and ancient saints reached blessedness!\\nMoreover, for the upholding of thy kind,\\nAction thou should\\'st embrace. What the wise choose\\nThe unwise people take; what best men do\\nThe multitude will follow. Look on me,\\nThou Son of Pritha! in the three wide worlds\\nI am not bound to any toil, no height\\nAwaits to scale, no gift remains to gain,\\nYet I act here! and, if I acted not--\\nEarnest and watchful--those that look to me\\nFor guidance, sinking back to sloth again\\nBecause I slumbered, would decline from good,\\nAnd I should break earth\\'s order and commit\\nHer offspring unto ruin, Bharata!\\nEven as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense,\\nSo let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set\\nTo bring the world deliverance, and its bliss;\\nNot sowing in those simple, busy hearts\\nSeed of despair. Yea! let each play his part\\nIn all he finds to do, with unyoked soul.\\nAll things are everywhere by Nature wrought\\nIn interaction of the qualities.\\nThe fool, cheated by self, thinks, \"This I did\"\\nAnd \"That I wrought; \"but--ah, thou strong-armed Prince!--\\nA better-lessoned mind, knowing the play\\nOf visible things within the world of sense,\\nAnd how the qualities must qualify,\\nStandeth aloof even from his acts. Th\\' untaught\\nLive mixed with them, knowing not Nature\\'s way,\\nOf highest aims unwitting, slow and dull.\\nThose make thou not to stumble, having the light;\\nBut all thy dues discharging, for My sake,\\nWith meditation centred inwardly,\\nSeeking no profit, satisfied, serene,\\nHeedless of issue--fight! They who shall keep\\nMy ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts,\\nHave quittance from all issue of their acts;\\nBut those who disregard My ordinance,\\nThinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss,\\nConfused and foolish. \\'Sooth, the instructed one\\nDoth of his kind, following what fits him most:\\nAnd lower creatures of their kind; in vain\\nContending \\'gainst the law. Needs must it be\\nThe objects of the sense will stir the sense\\nTo like and dislike, yet th\\' enlightened man\\nYields not to these, knowing them enemies.\\nFinally, this is better, that one do\\nHis own task as he may, even though he fail,\\nThan take tasks not his own, though they seem good.\\nTo die performing duty is no ill;\\nBut who seeks other roads shall wander still.\\n\\nArjuna.\\nYet tell me, Teacher! by what force doth man\\nGo to his ill, unwilling; as if one\\nPushed him that evil path?\\n\\nKrishna.\\nKama it is!\\nPassion it is! born of the Darknesses,\\nWhich pusheth him. Mighty of appetite,\\nSinful, and strong is this!--man\\'s enemy!\\nAs smoke blots the white fire, as clinging rust\\nMars the bright mirror, as the womb surrounds\\nThe babe unborn, so is the world of things\\nFoiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh.\\nThe wise fall, caught in it; the unresting foe\\nIt is of wisdom, wearing countless forms,\\nFair but deceitful, subtle as a flame.\\nSense, mind, and reason--these, O Kunti\\'s Son!\\nAre booty for it; in its play with these\\nIt maddens man, beguiling, blinding him.\\nTherefore, thou noblest child of Bharata!\\nGovern thy heart!

Albeit I be\\nUnborn, undying, indestructible,\\nThe Lord of all things living; not the less--\\nBy Maya, by my magic which I stamp\\nOn floating Nature-forms, the primal vast--\\nI come, and go, and come. When Righteousness\\nDeclines, O Bharata! when Wickedness\\nIs strong, I rise, from age to age, and take\\nVisible shape, and move a man with men,\\nSuccouring the good, thrusting the evil back,\\nAnd setting Virtue on her seat again.\\nWho knows the truth touching my births on earth\\nAnd my divine work, when he quits the flesh\\nPuts on its load no more, falls no more down\\nTo earthly birth: to Me he comes, dear Prince!\\nMany there be who come! from fear set free,\\nFrom anger, from desire; keeping their hearts\\nFixed upon me--my Faithful--purified\\nBy sacred flame of Knowledge. Such as these\\nMix with my being. Whoso worship me,\\nThem I exalt; but all men everywhere\\nShall fall into my path; albeit, those souls\\nWhich seek reward for works, make sacrifice\\nNow, to the lower gods. I say to thee\\nHere have they their reward. But I am He\\nMade the Four Castes, and portioned them a place\\nAfter their qualities and gifts. Yea, I\\nCreated, the Reposeful; I that live\\nImmortally, made all those mortal births:\\nFor works soil not my essence, being works\\nWrought uninvolved.[FN#7] Who knows me acting thus\\nUnchained by action, action binds not him;\\nAnd, so perceiving, all those saints of old\\nWorked, seeking for deliverance. Work thou\\nAs, in the days gone by, thy fathers did.\\n\\nThou sayst, perplexed, It hath been asked before\\nBy singers and by sages, \"What is act,\\nAnd what inaction? \"I will teach thee this,\\nAnd, knowing, thou shalt learn which work doth save\\nNeeds must one rightly meditate those three--\\nDoing,--not doing,--and undoing. Here\\nThorny and dark the path is! He who sees\\nHow action may be rest, rest action--he\\nIs wisest \\'mid his kind; he hath the truth!\\nHe doeth well, acting or resting. Freed\\nIn all his works from prickings of desire,\\nBurned clean in act by the white fire of truth,\\nThe wise call that man wise; and such an one,\\nRenouncing fruit of deeds, always content.\\nAlways self-satisfying, if he works,\\nDoth nothing that shall stain his separate soul,\\nWhich--quit of fear and hope--subduing self--\\nRejecting outward impulse--yielding up\\nTo body\\'s need nothing save body, dwells\\nSinless amid all sin, with equal calm\\nTaking what may befall, by grief unmoved,\\nUnmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same\\nIn good and evil fortunes; nowise bound\\nBy bond of deeds. Nay, but of such an one,\\nWhose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate,\\nWhose heart is set on truth--of such an one\\nWhat work he does is work of sacrifice,\\nWhich passeth purely into ash and smoke\\nConsumed upon the altar! All\\'s then God!\\nThe sacrifice is Brahm, the ghee and grain\\nAre Brahm, the fire is Brahm, the flesh it eats\\nIs Brahm, and unto Brahm attaineth he\\nWho, in such office, meditates on Brahm.\\nSome votaries there be who serve the gods\\nWith flesh and altar-smoke; but other some\\nWho, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite\\nWith will of worship. Of the which be they\\nWho, in white flame of continence, consume\\nJoys of the sense, delights of eye and ear,\\nForgoing tender speech and sound of song:\\nAnd they who, kindling fires with torch of Truth,\\nBurn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss\\nOf youth and love, renouncing happiness:\\nAnd they who lay for offering there their wealth,\\nTheir penance, meditation, piety,\\nTheir steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore\\nPainfully gained with long austerities:\\nAnd they who, making silent sacrifice,\\nDraw in their breath to feed the flame of thought,\\nAnd breathe it forth to waft the heart on high,\\nGoverning the ventage of each entering air\\nLest one sigh pass which helpeth not the soul:\\nAnd they who, day by day denying needs,\\nLay life itself upon the altar-flame,\\nBurning the body wan. Lo! all these keep\\nThe rite of offering, as if they slew\\nVictims; and all thereby efface much sin.\\nYea! and who feed on the immortal food\\nLeft of such sacrifice, to Brahma pass,\\nTo The Unending. But for him that makes\\nNo sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot\\nEven in the present world. How should he share\\nAnother, O thou Glory of thy Line?\\n\\nIn sight of Brahma all these offerings\\nAre spread and are accepted! Comprehend\\nThat all proceed by act; for knowing this,\\nThou shalt be quit of doubt. The sacrifice\\nWhich Knowledge pays is better than great gifts\\nOffered by wealth, since gifts\\' worth--O my Prince!\\nLies in the mind which gives, the will that serves:\\nAnd these are gained by reverence, by strong search,\\nBy humble heed of those who see the Truth\\nAnd teach it. Knowing Truth, thy heart no more\\nWill ache with error, for the Truth shall show\\nAll things subdued to thee, as thou to Me.\\nMoreover, Son of Pandu! wert thou worst\\nOf all wrong-doers, this fair ship of Truth\\nShould bear thee safe and dry across the sea\\nOf thy transgressions.

Nay, Arjuna! call\\nThat the true piety which most removes\\nEarth-aches and ills, where one is moderate\\nIn eating and in resting, and in sport;\\nMeasured in wish and act; sleeping betimes,\\nWaking betimes for duty.\\n\\nWhen the man,\\nSo living, centres on his soul the thought\\nStraitly restrained--untouched internally\\nBy stress of sense--then is he Yukta. See!\\nSteadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind;\\nSuch is the likeness of the Yogi\\'s mind\\nShut from sense-storms and burning bright to Heaven.\\nWhen mind broods placid, soothed with holy wont;\\nWhen Self contemplates self, and in itself\\nHath comfort; when it knows the nameless joy\\nBeyond all scope of sense, revealed to soul--\\nOnly to soul! and, knowing, wavers not,\\nTrue to the farther Truth; when, holding this,\\nIt deems no other treasure comparable,\\nBut, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook\\nBy any gravest grief, call that state \"peace,\"\\nThat happy severance Yoga; call that man\\nThe perfect Yogin!\\n\\nSteadfastly the will\\nMust toil thereto, till efforts end in ease,\\nAnd thought has passed from thinking.

He who thus vows\\nHis soul to the Supreme Soul, quitting sin,\\nPasses unhindered to the endless bliss\\nOf unity with Brahma. He so vowed,\\nSo blended, sees the Life-Soul resident\\nIn all things living, and all living things\\nIn that Life-Soul contained. And whoso thus\\nDiscerneth Me in all, and all in Me,\\nI never let him go; nor looseneth he\\nHold upon Me; but, dwell he where he may,\\nWhate\\'er his life, in Me he dwells and lives,\\nBecause he knows and worships Me, Who dwell\\nIn all which lives, and cleaves to Me in all.\\nArjuna! if a man sees everywhere--\\nTaught by his own similitude--one Life,\\nOne Essence in the Evil and the Good,\\nHold him a Yogi, yea! well-perfected!\\n\\nArjuna.\\nSlayer of Madhu! yet again, this Yog,\\nThis Peace, derived from equanimity,\\nMade known by thee--I see no fixity\\nTherein, no rest, because the heart of men\\nIs unfixed, Krishna! rash, tumultuous,\\nWilful and strong.

No!\\nNor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him,\\nBecause no heart that holds one right desire\\nTreadeth the road of loss! He who should fail,\\nDesiring righteousness, cometh at death\\nUnto the Region of the Just; dwells there\\nMeasureless years, and being born anew,\\nBeginneth life again in some fair home\\nAmid the mild and happy.

Such birth\\nIs hard to be obtained on this earth, Chief!\\nSo hath he back again what heights of heart\\nHe did achieve, and so he strives anew\\nTo perfectness, with better hope, dear Prince!\\nFor by the old desire he is drawn on\\nUnwittingly; and only to desire\\nThe purity of Yog is to pass\\nBeyond the Sabdabrahm, the spoken Ved.\\nBut, being Yogi, striving strong and long,\\nPurged from transgressions, perfected by births\\nFollowing on births, he plants his feet at last\\nUpon the farther path.

Sweet\\nAs Amrit is its first taste, but its last\\nBitter as poison. \\'Tis of Rajas, Prince!\\nAnd foul and \"dark\" the Pleasure is which springs\\nFrom sloth and sin and foolishness; at first\\nAnd at the last, and all the way of life\\nThe soul bewildering. \\'Tis of Tamas, Prince!\\n\\nFor nothing lives on earth, nor \\'midst the gods\\nIn utmost heaven, but hath its being bound\\nWith these three Qualities, by Nature framed.\\n\\nThe work of Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas,\\nAnd Sudras, O thou Slayer of thy Foes!\\nIs fixed by reason of the Qualities\\nPlanted in each:\\n\\nA Brahman\\'s virtues, Prince!\\nBorn of his nature, are serenity,\\nSelf-mastery, religion, purity,\\nPatience, uprightness, learning, and to know\\nThe truth of things which be. A Kshatriya\\'s pride,\\nBorn of his nature, lives in valour, fire,\\nConstancy, skilfulness, spirit in fight,\\nAnd open-handedness and noble mien,\\nAs of a lord of men. A Vaisya\\'s task,\\nBorn with his nature, is to till the ground,\\nTend cattle, venture trade. A Sudra\\'s state,\\nSuiting his nature, is to minister.\\n\\nWhoso performeth--diligent, content--\\nThe work allotted him, whate\\'er it be,\\nLays hold of perfectness! Hear how a man\\nFindeth perfection, being so content:\\nHe findeth it through worship--wrought by work--\\nOf Him that is the Source of all which lives,\\nOf HIM by Whom the universe was stretched.\\n\\nBetter thine own work is, though done with fault,\\nThan doing others\\' work, ev\\'n excellently.\\nHe shall not fall in sin who fronts the task\\nSet him by Nature\\'s hand! Let no man leave\\nHis natural duty, Prince! though it bear blame!\\nFor every work hath blame, as every flame\\nIs wrapped in smoke! Only that man attains\\nPerfect surcease of work whose work was wrought\\nWith mind unfettered, soul wholly subdued,\\nDesires for ever dead, results renounced.\\n\\nLearn from me, Son of Kunti! also this,\\nHow one, attaining perfect peace, attains\\nBRAHM, the supreme, the highest height of all!\\n\\nDevoted--with a heart grown pure, restrained\\nIn lordly self-control, forgoing wiles\\nOf song and senses, freed from love and hate,\\nDwelling \\'mid solitudes, in diet spare,\\nWith body, speech, and will tamed to obey,\\nEver to holy meditation vowed,\\nFrom passions liberate, quit of the Self,\\nOf arrogance, impatience, anger, pride;\\nFreed from surroundings, quiet, lacking nought--\\nSuch an one grows to oneness with the BRAHM;\\nSuch an one, growing one with BRAHM, serene,\\nSorrows no more, desires no more; his soul,\\nEqually loving all that lives, loves well\\nMe, Who have made them, and attains to Me.\\nBy this same love and worship doth he know\\nMe as I am, how high and wonderful,\\nAnd knowing, straightway enters into Me.\\nAnd whatsoever deeds he doeth--fixed\\nIn Me, as in his refuge--he hath won\\nFor ever and for ever by My grace\\nTh\\' Eternal Rest! So win thou! In thy thoughts\\nDo all thou dost for Me! Renounce for Me!\\nSacrifice heart and mind and will to Me!\\nLive in the faith of Me! In faith of Me\\nAll dangers thou shalt vanquish, by My grace;\\nBut, trusting to thyself and heeding not,\\nThou can\\'st but perish! If this day thou say\\'st,\\nRelying on thyself, \"I will not fight!\"\\nVain will the purpose prove! thy qualities\\nWould spur thee to the war. What thou dost shun,\\nMisled by fair illusions, thou wouldst seek\\nAgainst thy will, when the task comes to thee\\nWaking the promptings in thy nature set.\\nThere lives a Master in the hearts of men\\nMaketh their deeds, by subtle pulling--strings,\\nDance to what tune HE will. With all thy soul\\nTrust Him, and take Him for thy succour, Prince!\\nSo--only so, Arjuna!--shalt thou gain--\\nBy grace of Him--the uttermost repose,\\nThe Eternal Place!\\n\\nThus hath been opened thee\\nThis Truth of Truths, the Mystery more hid\\nThan any secret mystery. Meditate!\\nAnd--as thou wilt--then act!\\n\\nNay! but once more\\nTake My last word, My utmost meaning have!\\nPrecious thou art to Me; right well-beloved!\\nListen! I tell thee for thy comfort this.\\nGive Me thy heart! adore Me! serve Me! cling\\nIn faith and love and reverence to Me!\\nSo shalt thou come to Me! I promise true,\\nFor thou art sweet to Me!\\n\\nAnd let go those--\\nRites and writ duties! Fly to Me alone!\\nMake Me thy single refuge! I will free\\nThy soul from all its sins! Be of good cheer!\\n\\n[Hide, the holy Krishna saith,\\nThis from him that hath no faith,\\nHim that worships not, nor seeks\\nWisdom\\'s teaching when she speaks:\\nHide it from all men who mock;\\nBut, wherever, \\'mid the flock\\nOf My lovers, one shall teach\\nThis divinest, wisest, speech--\\nTeaching in the faith to bring\\nTruth to them, and offering\\nOf all honour unto Me--\\nUnto Brahma cometh he!\\nNay, and nowhere shall ye find\\nAny man of all mankind\\nDoing dearer deed for Me;\\nNor shall any dearer be\\nIn My earth. Yea, furthermore,\\nWhoso reads this converse o\\'er,\\nHeld by Us upon the plain,\\nPondering piously and fain,\\nHe hath paid Me sacrifice!\\n(Krishna speaketh in this wise!)\\nYea, and whoso, full of faith,\\nHeareth wisely what it saith,\\nHeareth meekly,--when he dies,\\nSurely shall his spirit rise\\nTo those regions where the Blest,\\nFree of flesh, in joyance rest.]\\n\\nHath this been heard by thee, O Indian Prince!\\nWith mind intent? hath all the ignorance--\\nWhich bred thy trouble--vanished, My Arjun?\\n\\nArjuna.\\nTrouble and ignorance are gone! the Light\\nHath come unto me, by Thy favour, Lord!\\nNow am I fixed! my doubt is fled away!\\nAccording to Thy word, so will I do!\\n\\nSanjaya.\\nThus gathered I the gracious speech of Krishna, O my King!\\nThus have I told, with heart a-thrill, this wise and wondrous thing\\nBy great Vyasa\\'s learning writ, how Krishna\\'s self made known\\nThe Yoga, being Yoga\\'s Lord. So is the high truth shown!\\nAnd aye, when I remember, O Lord my King, again\\nArjuna and the God in talk, and all this holy strain,\\nGreat is my gladness: when I muse that splendour, passing speech,\\nOf Hari, visible and plain, there is no tongue to reach\\nMy marvel and my love and bliss. O Archer-Prince! all hail!\\nO Krishna, Lord of Yoga! surely there shall not fail\\nBlessing, and victory, and power, for Thy most mighty sake,\\nWhere this song comes of Arjun, and how with God he spake.\\n',\n",
